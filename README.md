# JavaScript Libraries Unravelled

With the arrival of CoffeeScript and CoffeeScript source maps, it's now possible to code sophisticated applications without touching a single line of JavaScript. No doubt some people are pretty happy with that, but no doubt many will still want to get under the hood and understand what's going on behind all this obfuscation.

The pages are hosted on the wiki pages of this repo:




### CoffeeScript

- [Fat arrow,`=>`](https://github.com/JofArnold/javascript-libraries-unravelled/wiki/CoffeeScript-Fat-Arrow)
- [Array manipulation](https://github.com/JofArnold/javascript-libraries-unravelled/wiki/CoffeeScript-Array-Manipulation)
- `constructor` and `extends` *[coming soon]*

### Underscore

- _.bindAll *[coming soon]*


## Todo

Please feel free to make comments and amend. This is a work in progress and I've not necessarily checked all the code compiles and is free of typos.

- Explain `constructor` and `extends`
- Explain loops and comprehensions, in particular the brackets in `count = (num for num in [10..1])`
